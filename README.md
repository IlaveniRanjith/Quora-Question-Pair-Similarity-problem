# Quora-Question-Pair-Similarity-problem
In this we Described the problem of question pair similarity in Quora.
## Problem Statement
  Identify which questions on Quora are duplicate. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered. 
  We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
In Order to predict the questions are similar or not we used Following Machine Learning Models 
  1. XG Boost Classifier
  2. Random Forest Classifier
  3. Logistic Regression Classifier
  4. Decision tree Classifier
## Results

| Models       |    Accuracy Score |
| :----------- |  ---------------: |
|Decision Tree |  80.35%           |
|Random Forest |  80.35%           |
|Logistic Regression |  71%           |
|XGBoost |  79.7%            |

                               
<!-- **Models**                         **Accuracy Score**
Decision Tree-------------------->80.35% ,
Random Forest-------------------->80.35% ,
