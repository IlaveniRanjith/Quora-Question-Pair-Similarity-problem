## Results
                               
**Models**                         **Accuracy Score**
Decision Tree-------------------->79.5784% ,
Random Forest-------------------->79.5784% ,
Logistic Regression-------------->72.323% ,
XGBoost-------------------------->79.588% .


We Can Coclude that by seeing above results the XG Boost Classifier gives the best results according to Accuracy.
